# LKL Website
This repository contains the code for a static and responsive website developed as part of my first university project. The website focuses on the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) and provides information such as team tables, news, match history, match schedule, and a gallery. Additionally, the project includes a prototype of a ticketing system where users can select seats, view seat prices, and calculate the total price.

Features
The LKL website offers the following features:

Team Tables: The website displays tables showcasing the current standings of the teams participating in the Lithuanian Basketball League.

News: Users can access the latest news and updates related to the LKL, providing them with information on team transfers, game highlights, and other relevant updates.

Match History Carousel: The website showcases a carousel that displays the historical data of past matches, including details such as teams, scores, and dates. Users can navigate through the carousel to explore various match results.

Match Schedule: The website presents an updated schedule of upcoming LKL matches, enabling users to stay informed about the dates, times, and locations of future games.

Gallery: Users can browse through a gallery that includes images related to the LKL, including pictures of teams, players, memorable moments, and the overall excitement of the league.

Ticketing System Prototype: The project includes a prototype of a ticketing system. Users can select seats by clicking on them, and the selected seats will be highlighted in green. Each seat is assigned a price, and the total price is calculated and displayed dynamically as users make their selections.
